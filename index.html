                  Located on the first floor of the TIU Ikebukuro Campus, this small cafeteria has surprisingly good food. Every week the main menu consisting of three dishes is changed. Among the three dishes, one of them is always a halal option (for the Muslim customers like myself), the other is always a vegeterian option, and the last one is normal (usually containing pork). Additionally the cafeteria gives student discounts to any TIU students and the price is greatly reduced!

                  Recommendation: <br>
                  1. The halal options are always pretty good. Rating: 6/10 <br>
                  2. The fried chicken set (also halal) is the best bang for buck for only 540yen (as of May 2024). Rating: 7/10

                  Toribushi is a new halal ramen spot in Ikebukuro and quite close to the Ikebukuro station. The restaurant is very small and only houses 6 people. I don't usually have ramen as it's usually not halal, so finding a halal ramen spot close to campus is surely delightful.

                Recommendation: <br>
                1. Roasted chicken spicy ramen (not that spicy for me). Rating: 5/10 <br>
                2. Roasted chicken tsukamen is the best one. Very flavorful compared to their normal ramen broth. Rating: 7/10

                  This is the closest Indian restaurant from the Ike campus if you're craving for good Indian food. Usually all Indian places have the same interior design and food in my opinion, but this one felt a bit different. I don't know if they have any halal certification but it is a popular choice among the Muslim students in TIU.

                1. I only had the biryani here and it was good. Quite flavorful but small in quantity. Rating: 6/10 <br>

                  This is one of my favorite spots in the entire Ikebukuro area. Freshness Burgers really do serve some fresh burgers. And their hot sauce collection is superb for someone like me who loves spice. I usually dine here by myself and occassionally come with friends. Great spot for a quick break.

                  Went here once because of the "halal ramen hype". Was quite disappointed with the food. The staff can barely speak Japanese or English. But most importantly, the food was ok-ish. Maybe the taste of chinese ramen is not for me. But I still included them in the list because the price to quantity ratio is good.
